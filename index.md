## About me

I've just completed General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course. Three months of full-time, full-on learning! It has been an awesome experience, giving me a solid foundation to build on as I learn and grow.  

My background is in IT, working with people, processes, and data. After spending so many years as a Business Analyst and technology generalist, I wanted to pursue more technical roles and decided to upskill in data science tools and techniques.

I'm looking forward to building my skills through experience and collaboration.

#### Web Scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Evaluate models 
June 2021 

For data-related jobs: identify factors which impact salary and distinguish job category.  Scrape my own dataset from Seek.com.au  
◆ Dataset: 12,000 jobs scraped from Seek.com.au  
◆ Tools: Jupyter Notebook & Python, Scrapy & spiders  
◆ Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, SciPy, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

#### Feature Engineering & Machine Learning (ML) Regression models 
May 2021

Given sales and property information: estimate the sale price of properties based on their "fixed" characteristics, and the impact of possible renovations.
