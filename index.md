## About me

I am a junior Data Scientist who is passionate about finding ways to use technology to help people’s lives get easier.

I have extensive experience spanning over 10 years in STEM, technology and data. Throughout my work as a Business Analyst I was the communication bridge between business and IT, creating shared understanding and engaged stakeholders. My stakeholders and subject matter experts ranged from technical specialists, policy specialists and end users, to IT managers and Senior Executives. I have worked in large organisations such as government departments and Atlassian, which allowed me opportunities to work with people across Australia and the world.

I am looking for opportunities to use my curiosity and experiences to enable people to discover mysteries hidden in the worlds of data. I enjoy collaborative teams where I can contribute and learn from my colleagues.
