## About me

I've just completed General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course. Three months of full-time, full-on learning! It has been an awesome experience, giving me a solid foundation to build on as I learn and grow.  

My background is in IT, working with people, processes, and data. After spending so many years as a Business Analyst and technology generalist, I wanted to pursue more technical roles and decided to upskill in data science tools and techniques.

I'm looking forward to building my skills through experience and collaboration.


## Recent Projects
